## How can I contribute?

### Report bugs, propose new features or send feedback

If you encountered a bug, please tell about it. Go to the AGrilla [issues page][issues] and create a new issue. Explain what you did and how you encountered it, and what happened afterwards. Most importantly, state how to go about and recreate the same error.

I would like very much to know how you feel about the software and hear your suggestions for improvements, new features, etc. Please, go to the AGrilla [discussions page][discussions] and create a new discussion. Explain your ideas, suggestions and requests so that we can get an agreement on what to do and how to proceed.

Send your feedback to improve the program and fix the bugs you find. Thank you!
